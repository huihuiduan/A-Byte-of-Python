# Using a Source File
# Python does not use comments except for the special case of the first line here. It is called the shebang
# line - whenever the first two characters of the source file are #! followed by the location of a program,
# this tells your Linux/Unix system that this program should be run with this interpreter when you execute
# the program.

#!/usr/bin/python
# Filename: helloworld.py
print('Hello World')



# Getting Help

# use in your program.
