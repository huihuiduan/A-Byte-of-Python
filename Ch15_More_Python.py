# Special methods of __init__ and __del__
'''
__init__(self, ...) This method is called just before the newly created
object is returned for usage.

__del__(self) Called just before the object is destroyed

__str__(self) Called when we use the print statement with the
object or when str() is used.

__lt__(self, other) Called when the less than operator ( < ) is used.
Similarly, there are special methods for all the operators
(+, >, etc.)

__getitem__(self, key) Called when x[key] indexing operation is used.

__len__(self) Called when the built-in len() function is used
for the sequence object.

# Receiving Tuples and Lists in Functions

# There is a special way of receiving parameters to a function as a tuple or a dictionary using the * or **
# prefix respectively. This is useful when taking variable number of arguments in the function.

# Due to the * prefix on the args variable, all extra arguments passed to the function are stored in args
# as a tuple. If a ** prefix had been used instead, the extra parameters would be considered to be key/
# value pairs of a dictionary.
